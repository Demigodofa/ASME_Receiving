## Future Add-ons

This folder tracks planned but currently disabled integrations.

### Firebase (Storage + Export Index)

- Intended for future "Export to Cloud" feature.
- PDFs, photos, and scans would upload to Firebase Storage under user-scoped paths.
- Optional Firestore metadata would track export status, file paths, and usage.
- Cloud Functions would enforce per-user storage caps and update usage documents.
